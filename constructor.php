<!--Constructor-->
What is a Constructor in PHP OOP?
In PHP, a constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically executed
 when an object of that class is created using the new keyword. Its primary purpose is to
  initialize the objectâ€™s properties with values, ensuring the object is ready for use.

Key Points:
Defined with the __construct method name.
Runs automatically upon object creation.
Often used to set initial values for properties via parameters.
Helps create objects in a consistent, predefined state. 

<?php

//Define the Book Class
class Book{
    //Properties
    public $title;
    public $author;
    //Constructor method
    public function __construct($title,$author){
        $this->title=$title;
        $this->author=$author;

        echo "New student registered: {$this->title}, Age: {$this->author}";
    }
}
$student=new Book("hari","Mongli")
?>

<?php
class Person {
    public $name;
    public $age;

    // Constructor Method
    public function __construct($name, $age) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->age = $age;
    }

    public function introduce() {
        echo "Hello, my name is $this->name and I am $this->age years old.<br>";
    }
}

// Create object and pass values directly to constructor
$person1 = new Person("Shubham", 28);

// Call a method
$person1->introduce();
?>
